# PraktikFinal By Simon, Sophus and Sebastian.

## We chose the community challenge (https://corolab.dk/projekter/faellesskaber-med-plads-til-alle/), where the goal is to create a solution for pupils and students that are unable to thrive in school or just in general. 
## We have chosen to create a website using the MERN stack, that will hopefully help the students and pupils that are in need to thrive, and help them find communities they can feel a part of.
